##### Abstract #####

##### Introduction #####

Dispersal is a key individual-based process influencing many life-history attributes and scaling up to population-level properties (e.g., metapopulation connectivity). In the specific case of plants, largely sessile organisms, dispersal has three basic components: 1) a distinct (sessile) source, the maternal plant producing the fruits or the paternal tree acting as a source of pollen; 2) a distance component between source and target locations; and 3) a vector actually performing the movement entailing the dispersal event. Therefore, plant movement differs in important natural history details from animal dispersal, yet both can be assessed within a common conceptual framework (e.g., [#Nathan:2006]). Characteristically, animal-assisted plant dispersal has three distinct, highly integrated, components missing in the process of animal dispersal: the properties of the source (parental) plant, that mediate in the foraging of the animal vector (pollinator or frugivore), the intrinsic properties of the propagule, and the functional characteristics of the animal vector who performs the movement [#Nathan:2008].    

The movement of pollen and seeds by animals and its consequences have intrigued population geneticists and field ecologists since the infancy of both research disciplines. Each has generated an impressive body of theoretical and empirical research through the past decades, yet advances have long been co-existing in ‘parallel worlds’ and the great synergistic potential of population genetics and demography for the study of plant dispersal by animals remains little explored. Knowledge gaps still having the imprint of this conceptual disconnection include the idea of long distance dispersal, and the paradoxes of forest fragmentation effects on genetic diversity [#Kramer:2008], survival and persistence of relict tree species [#Hampe:2011], rapid post-Pleistocene recolonization of vast continental areas in response to climate modification [#Clark:1998a][#Clark:1998b], among other persisting issues. This conceptual isolation has been exacerbated by technical difficulties for the robust characterization of dispersal events, especially those involving movement over long-distances (long-distance dispersal, LDD). Some progress has recently been made through the fast-paced implementation of molecular tools in ecological research labs. But much of the population geneticist and ecologist communities remains unaware of the state of the art in each other and likely under-appreciates their potential to validate and enrich dispersal studies. In particular, LDD events remain difficult to assess, both technically- with serious methodological problems for its reliable estimation- and conceptually. Our aim here is to review the LDD concept with a specific emphasis on dispersal of plant propagules (seeds and pollen), providing an extended definition that might be helpful in the robust quantification of LDD events.   

##### Empirical Studies of Seed Dispersal #####

Two main conceptual approaches have been used to assess dispersal (Fig. 1). The “forward” approach attempts to track the dispersal events away from the known sources, e.g., by tracking the movement patterns of frugivores as they leave fruiting plants after feeding (Fig. 1A). This is the main approach used in the movement ecology framework, with extensive application to animal movement based on the use of advanced biotelemetry. The “backward” approach  attempts to reconstruct the most likely source of a dispersed propagule by inferring the sources given the propagule delivery pattern, the fecundity of potential sources, and the dispersal function (Fig. 1B), i.e., by using an inverse modeling approach. The main technical challenge in Fig. 1A is to sample enough dispersal events away from the source to be able to fully characterize the tail (LDD events) of the dispersal function. In Fig. 1B, the main challenge is to have a robust sampling scheme with propagule collectors (e.g., seed traps) and a good characterization of the potential sources to derive robust estimates of the actual sources. Both approaches are limited logistically by the difficulties to sample the vast areas required to assess LDD events from the focal source population.    

We aim at providing a general framework for the quantitative analysis of LDD events so that estimates of its frequency and extent could be comparable across different study systems. We argue that both demographic and genetic elements are needed for this framework, most likely requiring a combination of field-based movement data and genetic analyses.    

Long-distance dispersal is currently one of the most debated topics in dispersal ecology; it defines the connectedness within the network of local populations and the possibilities for range expansion and successful colonization events. We propose a first genetically-based operational definition of what a long-distance dispersal event actually is, and compile the existing empirical literature on dispersal distances. We also show how molecular tools have been used to identify the respective contributions of different animal species to the dispersal kernels of pollen and seeds. Finally, we highlight potential applications of molecular markers beyond the quantification of just the dispersal distances that prevails in current studies, e.g., experimental approaches to assess dispersal limitation and Janzen-Connell effects.


##### Long-Distance Dispersal #####

Long-distance dispersal (LDD) is a major component of the population dynamics, genetic structure, and biogeographic history of plant species. It determines the colonization ability of new habitats and the possibilities for fragmented populations to sustain a cohesive metapopulation by immigration-emigration dynamics that rely on LDD events. Yet our current understanding of the extent, frequency, and consequences of LDD is very limited. On one hand, theoretical models fail to predict accurately the behavior of the tail of the dispersal functions, and thus fail to predict very basic properties of LDD. On the other hand, we still have very limited documentation of actual LDD events in natural populations and we still see LDD as a sporadic, rarely far-reaching process still marked with the stamp of natural history curiosity.
Here we propose an explicit definition of LDD and what constitutes a LDD event. Previous definitions of dispersal patterns emphasized only their distance components and characterized LDD events basically in terms of geographic distance between a dispersed propagule (or an established early seedling) and its most likely maternal or paternal (in case of pollen) source.

NOTES
Breeding unit size. Donor number is related to the size of the breeding unit (N individuals) as d= Np, where d is the number of different pollen parent genotypes represented in a maternal tree’s fruit crop and p is the expected proportion of trees in staminate phase at any given time. Assuming, conservatively, that individual trees reproduce asynchronously twice per year 6 and that staminate and pistillate flowering phases each last seven days 20, p is calculated to be 0.0712. Although these estimates could be effected by mosaicism 21 (the fusion of genetically distinct individuals), its frequency in the species examined here is low. 

Breeding unit area and radii. These parameters were calculated from paternity-analysis-based estimates of breeding unit size (Nˆdˆ; Table2) and the censused densities of adult, reproductively mature trees over 15 km2 BCI. Based on the long-term censuses of C. Handley and E. Kalko, 6, 108 and 20 adults of F. dugandii, F. obtusifolia and F. popenoei, respectively, are known to occur on BCI. Because these species exhibit little spatial aggregation over the area censused, these densities are assumed to be representative of forested areas surrounding BCI, a conservative assumption given that approximately one-third of the area within 10 km of BCI is occupied by Lake Gatun where figs are absent. Breeding unit radii estimate the distances pollen-bearing, female fig wasps routinely disperse in search of receptive host trees. Although actual breeding populations of figs may deviate substantially from the assumed circular distribution, alternative structures (elliptical,for example)increase estimated wasp dispersal distances.

##### Genetic ‘neighborhood’ #####

For continuously distributed populations, Wright (1946) introduced the concept of a genetic ‘neighborhood’ that describes the local area within which most matings occur. In a two-dimensional land- scape, Wright’s neighborhood size (NS) is  

$NS = 4\pi\sigma^2 D$  

where D is density (number of individuals per unit area) and $\sigma$ (mean squared distance along one axis between birthplaces of parents and their offspring) is a measure of dispersal. _NS_ can be thought of as the number of reproducing individuals in a circle of radius $2\sigma$. Assuming that dispersal is Gaussian, a circle of this size would include ~87 % of the potential parents of individuals at the center (Wright, 1946).

If the dispersal of an individual between place of birth and breeding site is essentially random, it resembles a "drunkards walk". It has the same distribution as passive diffusion, a two-dimensional normal distribution.

If this is true, dispersal distance can simply measured as the standard deviation, $\sigma$, of the dispersal distribution.  A population "neighbourhood" can be defined approximately as a group of individuals who come from an area $2\sigma$ wide.

[Strictly, $\sigma$ is a valid measure of dispersal only if dispersal is exactly normally distributed. Many field studies have shown that dispersal is actually leptokurtic, i.e. most offspring breed very close to their parents, but some breed an enormous distance away. In practice, it doesn't much matter if dispersal is non-normal, provided it is not too extreme.]
